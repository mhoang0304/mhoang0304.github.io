            Common reader questions: “What are the most popular blog topics?” “How do I come up with a blog idea?” “What
            should I blog about?” “How to choose blog topics?” “What if I don’t know what to blog about?” “How do you
            start
            a blog?” We get questions like these a lot, and they usually come from people at their wit’s end.
            Want to know the big problem with blogging? Most people don’t know there’s a huge chance of failure, so they
            spend months or even years creating a blog that has zero chance of succeeding.
